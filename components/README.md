# LQS-IoT_Pylon Components

This directory groups **one service per folder** to match the modular Pylon design.

- `orion/`      – FIWARE Orion Context Broker
- `iota-json/`  – FIWARE IoT Agent for JSON
- `mongodb/`    – MongoDB backing store for Orion and the IoT Agent

Each subfolder is a home for service-specific configuration, notes, and future extensions
(e.g. individual compose snippets, Helm charts, or k8s manifests).
